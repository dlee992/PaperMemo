# PaperMemo

- The structure of PaperMemo will be consistent with that of papers in Mendeley.
- Each paper deserves to be judged, even if I do not understand it totally.
- I can note down comments and relevant stuffs, i.e., code repo address, dataset source, and original algorithm source.
- The essence is recording down my personal feelings, ideas, and practical expriences.
