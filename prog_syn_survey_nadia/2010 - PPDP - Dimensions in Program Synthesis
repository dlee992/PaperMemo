# 2010 - PPDP - Dimensions in Program Synthesis

- Gulwani thought program synthesis has three dimensions

## user intent

1. logicial specification
2. natural language
3. input-output examples
4. traces
5. programs

## search space

1. programs
   - operators
   - control structure
2. grammars
3. logics

## search technique

1. brute-force search
2. ***version space algebra***
3. machine learning based techniques
   - ***probabilistic inference***
   - genetic programming
4. logical reasoning based techniques
   - ***constraint generation***
   - ***constraint solving***

## Discussion Memo

1. What is ***probabilistic inference*** in program synthesis? How it works in actual context? => defer to Week 3, we will discuss this topic deeply.
2. What is ***version space algebra***? How it works? => Shaoyuan Chen will elaborately describe it on Thursday for us.
