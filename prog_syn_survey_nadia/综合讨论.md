## Type System

1. `Type Systems by Luca Cardelli:`这篇比较短, 41页, 值得一读 (recommended by `Wikipedia`).

2. A program fragment is `safe` if it does not cause `untrapped errors` to occur

3. `Thus, with respect to a given type system, the following holds for a strongly checked lan-`
   `guage: `

   1. `No untrapped errors occur (safety guarantee). `
   2. `None of the trapped errors designated as forbidden errors occur. `
   3. `Other trapped errors may occur; it is the programmer’s responsibility to avoid them.`

   | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
   | **Safe**   | ML, Java | LISP      |
   | **Unsafe** | C        | Assembler |


## Types and Programming Languages

1. `A type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute.`
2. `The importance of lambda calculus arises from the fact that it can be viewed simultaneously as a simple programming language in which computations can be described and as a mathematical object about which rigorous statements can be proved.`

## Type-and-Example-Directed Program Synthesis

1. 这些文章涉及到`type system`, `lambda calculus`, and `formal method`总是显得晦涩难懂
2.
