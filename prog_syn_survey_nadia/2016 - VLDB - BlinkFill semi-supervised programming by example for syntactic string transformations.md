# 2016 - VLDB - BlinkFill semi-supervised programming by example for syntactic string transformations

- data cleaning and reshaping (also called ***wrangling***)
- focus in spreadsheet domain
- ***sound*** and ***complete*** synthesis algorithm
- learn ***arbitrary*** *regular expression* tokens, and not support *conditionals* and *loops*

## What is *logical information*?

- 

## 1. Generation of Input Data Graph

- 

## 2. String transformation

- 

## 3. Synthesis algorithm

- 

## Directed graph of VSA (A clear explanation)

The graph of VSA contains 3 kinds of nodes:

1. **leaf node**: 多个等价程序
2. **intermediate union node**: 全部子节点的 set-union
3. **intermediate join node**: 全部子节点的 cross-product

- \p{Lu}: Upper case letter
- \p{Ll}: lower case letter
